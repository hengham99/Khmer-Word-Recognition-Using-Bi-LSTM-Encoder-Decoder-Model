Our project "Khmer Word Recognition Using Bi-LSTM Encoder-Decoder Model" is about making a tool to read handwritten Khmer words online. Khmer writing is very beautiful but also hard to learn, especially in handwriting, and there are no good tools that can understand different styles. We love the Khmer language, so we want to make learning easier and more fun. Our tool will recognize many handwriting styles using a big dataset and a Bi-LSTM model. This can help students, teachers, and people in schools, hospitals, banks, and other places. We will study other methods, make a new dataset, build the model, and create a simple tool that everyone can use.
