#Khmer Word Recognition Using Bi-LSTM Encoder-Decoder Model
The project "Khmer Word Recognition Using Bi-LSTM Encoder-Decoder Model" aims to develop an online tool for recognizing handwritten Khmer text, addressing the challenges posed by the language’s complex writing system. Khmer handwriting varies widely, making it difficult for learners to master and for existing systems to interpret, as no current online tools provide accurate recognition or feedback. This project seeks to create a solution that can accurately recognize diverse handwriting styles, leveraging a large custom dataset to improve model performance. By using a Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder model, the tool will not only enhance the learning experience for students but also offer practical benefits in fields such as education, healthcare, and finance. The project encompasses studying existing approaches, building a new dataset, developing the model, and creating a prototype tool that is user-friendly, reliable, and efficient.
